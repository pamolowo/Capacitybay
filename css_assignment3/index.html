          I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE.
           He inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple 
           greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.

        <p>
          What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short 
          story I've witten as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published)
          , almost every email I've written, has been written on machines created by apple.
          I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I encountered a PC. 
          Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek futue I dreamed of as a kid And through
          his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all 
          your amazing work
